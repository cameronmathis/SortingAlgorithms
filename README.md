## General info
This is a project I did in order to practice implementing sorting algorithms in Java. In order to run and learn more about each algorithm, navigate to the appropriate algorithm folder. You can also follow the setup instructions on this README to run all algorithms at once.

## Sorting algorithms
Implemented:
* Bubble Sort
* Heap Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Selection Sort

## Setup
In order to run, clone this repo onto your local machine. Once you have navigated to the project folder, run the command:

	$ ./run.sh [Array Size]

This will print out how long it took each algorithm to sort the same randomly generated array of given size.

## Status
Project is: _finished_

## Language details
Language used: Java </br>
Version used: 11.0.8
